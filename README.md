# Hand Gesture Recognition for Virtual Mouse Control

![Gesture Control](https://via.placeholder.com/600x200.png?text=Hand+Gesture+Recognition+for+Virtual+Mouse+Control)

## Overview

This project implements a hand gesture recognition system that allows users to control their computer's mouse using hand gestures. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and the MediaPipe library for hand tracking, this application enables intuitive interaction with your computer without the need for traditional input devices.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition using webcam input.
- Control mouse movements based on gestures (e.g., moving the mouse, clicking).
- Smooth mouse movements for a natural user experience.
- Supports customizable gestures.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Step-by-step Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-recognition.git
   cd hand-gesture-recognition
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy scikit-learn joblib
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Capture Data: Run the capture_data.py script to collect gesture data:

bash
Copy code
python capture_data.py
Train the Model: After capturing data, train your model with the train_model.py script:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Run the Model: To start using the gesture recognition for mouse control, run the run_model.py script:

bash
Copy code
python run_model.py
Exit: Press q to quit the application.

Training the Model
The model is trained using the collected gesture data. Make sure to define your gestures in the capture_data.py script and label them correctly. The training process involves normalizing the data and using a chosen machine learning algorithm (e.g., KNN, SVM, Random Forest).

Example Gesture Setup
You can customize the gestures by modifying the capture_data.py file. Ensure that you collect enough data samples for each gesture you plan to recognize.
